# youtube-downloader-(GUI)

I made the application a GUI.
I'm still a beginner so there maybe some easy ways to do things I have done.
So your oppinion is highly appreciated.

##There will be more features added in the future.
Currently there are only few options so if you like feel free to try.
It's better compilled so I highly suggest you to make it an .exe with pyinstaller or any program you like.

All the other files are from the original creator and the person who inspired me to make this. The GUI files are in the "YoutubeDownloader(GUI)" folder.
