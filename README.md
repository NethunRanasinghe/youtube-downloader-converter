# youtube-downloader-(GUI)

I made the application a GUI.
I'm still a beginner so there maybe some easy ways to do things I have done.
So your oppinion is highly appreciated.

##There will be more features added in the future.
Currently there are only few options so if you like feel free to try.
It's better compilled so I highly suggest you to make it an .exe with pyinstaller or any program you like.
